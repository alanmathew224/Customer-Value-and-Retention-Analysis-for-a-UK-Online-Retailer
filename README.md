# Data-Analyst-Project
Exploratory data analysis for an online store based in UK.

## 1. Background and Overview
The dataset originates from an online retail store based in the United Kingdom that specializes in gifts and home decoration products. The analysis covers two years of transaction records, from December 2009 to November 2011, including detailed information on products, transaction dates, quantities, and pricing.

For comparison purposes, the dataset is divided into two periods:

Year 1: December 1, 2009 – November 30, 2010

Year 2: December 1, 2010 – November 30, 2011

The year-over-year comparison shows only a 1% increase in total sales revenue and a 1% increase in the number of customers, indicating stagnant growth. When focusing exclusively on identified customers, revenue actually declined by 2% in the second year.

Additionally, the store lost 1,526 customers (35.78%) while acquiring 1,582 new customers, and a considerable portion of the customers who churned were high-value customers. This highlights the issue that the store is not effectively retaining its most valuable customer groups.

There are various strategies businesses can use to retain customers—such as loyalty programs, personalized offers, exclusive benefits, and enhanced customer service—but these approaches are only effective and cost-efficient when directed toward the appropriate customer segments.

Therefore, the core challenge lies in executing retention initiatives in a targeted and resource-efficient manner. To address this, the analysis focuses on customer segmentation based on customer value and behavioral patterns, enabling the store not only to retain high-value customers, but also to increase customer lifetime value and revenue through more precise and strategic engagement.
